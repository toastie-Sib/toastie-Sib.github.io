I have been a student at MSU pursuing a degree for Game Design.

My major at MSU has been Games and Interactive Media focusing on the Game Design area. I have also been working towards a minor in Computer Science. 

I have learned how to work kwith both the Unity and Godot game engines. I am also able to code in C#, C++, and Python.
